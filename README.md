# SimpleRatingBar

SimpleRatingBar allows us to create a RatingBar with margin between items

## Download
To add the SimpleRatingBar library to your Android Studio project, simply add the following gradle dependency:
```java
implementation 'com.github.kxbyte:SimpleRatingBar:1.0.0'
```

## Usage

To use the SimpleRatingBar on your app, add the following code to your layout:

```xml
<com.borjabravo.simpleratingbar.SimpleRatingBar
    android:id="@+id/simple_rating_bar"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:isIndicator="false"
    app:ratingCount="5"
    app:ratingMargin="15dp"
    app:ratingSize="42dp"/>
```    

You can choose other properties in order to show custom drawables of SimpleRatingBar, like **ratingEmpty**, **ratingHalf** and **ratingFilled**.
